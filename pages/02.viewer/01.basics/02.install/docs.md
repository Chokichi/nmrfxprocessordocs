##Java
NMRViewJ and the dataChord family of client software are written in the
Java programming language. Because of this we can produce one version of
the program which runs on many different operating systems. Basically,
any operating system that supports a recent version of the so-called
Java runtime environment (JRE) will potentially work. So most flavors of
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X will work.  Earlier
versions required that you had an appropriate version of Java 
installed on your computer.  Starting with version 9.x we
bundle a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) right in with the application.
There is no need to install Java yourself, or really even be
aware that this is a Java based application.
The Java that is embedded in the installer will be installed along with our software 
application, and in a way that doesn't conflict with your use of Java by other applications.  


## Obtaining and installing the software

NMRViewJ is normally obtained at the web site of One Moon Scientific, Inc.

###Registration

Proceed to the web site:

	http://www.onemoonscientific.com

To download any of the applications you need to login to the web site.  You can register for login by clicking on the Register button at the top right corner of the web site. 
Note: you may have a previous login name (an email address) and password (a 10 or more digit number).  These will not work on the new site.  You need to create your own login and password.

If you have a GMail account from Google you can use your Google email address to login.  Just click on the "g" near the bottom of the window that pops-up when you click Register.

###Download

Once you're registered and logged in to the site you can proceed to the Download area by clicking the  "Downloads" menu button in the main menu near the top of the web page.  Click on the application type you wish to download and you will be taken to the download page for that application.  At present there are 5 different download choices for each application.  Choose the one corresponding to your operating system.  Note that Windows and Linux versions have two choices, 32 bit or 64 bit.

The five different application downloads all consist of essentially the same software code, but the installer and embedded Java version is specific to the operating system.

###Installation

Once you've downloaded the installer you can start it, on Mac OS or Windows, by double-clicking on the installer.  On Linux computers you should open a terminal window and start it with the "sh" command (for example, "sh nvj_unix-x86_9_0_0-b59.sh").

Installation consists of responding to a few questions about where the application should be installed and what types of files should be linked to the application so it starts when they are opened.

If you need to install the application on multiple computers without using the graphical interface you can run the installer in "Unattended Mode".  Contact us for more information.

###Activation License

When the application starts up it may prompt you for an activation license.  Activation licenses are available by purchasing a license to use the software or with our extended demo licenses.  Demonstration/Unsupported Use licenses are available from the software download site.  These demonstration licenses will activate the software for a fixed period of time and can be repeatedly obtained for an indefinite period of use.  We strongly encourage commercial entities or research groups with adequate funding to purchase supported licenses.

If you have a current, paid license to use the software you can see your activation license by clicking on the "Display User License" menu entry on the Downloads menu entry of the web site.  If the email address associated with your user login corresponds to one associated with your paid account then the license will be displayed.  If you don't see your expected license please contact us.  We can associate the paid license with multiple email addresses.

 
###Starting the Program

You might want to drag the application to the Dock or place an alias on
the Desktop in order to make it convenient to startup NMRViewJ.

After installation you're ready to run NMRView or one of the dataChord
clients. On Windows the installer will place an NVJ icon on the desktop,
and place an entry in the Start menu. On Linux and Unix, the installer
should also install shortcuts. If it doesn't (and with some Window
manager it won't) you can start NMRView by executing the "nvj" shell
script from a terminal. You can also install shortcuts yourself. An icon
"nvjrybt128.png" is present in the NMRViewJ directory. You can use this
as the icon for your shortcuts.
