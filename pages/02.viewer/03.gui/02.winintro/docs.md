Starting with NMRViewJ 9.0 NMR spectra are generally displayed within
Canvas windows as compared to the specialized spectral display windows
used in previous versions of NMRViewJ. NMRView has few limits on the
user's ability to visualize NMR spectra. As with the number of datasets
one can open, there are no arbitrary limits on the number of canvas
windows that can be open at once. Likewise they can be displayed with
arbitrary locations and sizes on the desktop. Large numbers of canvas
windows in arbitrary locations can sometimes be more confusing than
useful so NMRViewJ also provides a variety of ways to group related
spectra inside a single canvas window. While only one- and
two-dimensional displays of spectra are possible, the choice of which
dataset dimensions correspond to which display axes is up to the user.
Different views, including variations on such parameters as dataset
dimensions; plot regions; and contour levels of the same spectrum, can
be displayed simultaneously in different display windows. A hallmark of
NMRViewJ is the fact that no matter how the spectra are displayed in
different windows the positions of the cross hairs in each window are
correlated with the positions in every other window in an automatic and
intuitive way.
